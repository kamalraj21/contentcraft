  <ul>
    <li>ðŸ‘¤ A <strong>solo creator</strong> balancing multiple hats,</li>
    <li>ðŸ§  A <strong>technical writer</strong> handling complex documentation,</li>
    <li>ðŸ‘¥ Or a <strong>content team</strong> managing dozens of stakeholdersâ€¦</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Where do tasks get delayed?</li>
    <li>Whatâ€™s still done manually?</li>
    <li>Where do quality issues or handoff failures occur?</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-subtitle">Action:</div>
  <ul class="section-list">
    <li><strong>Map the lifecycle</strong> â€” from <b>ideation to publication</b>.</li>
    <li><strong>Talk to stakeholders</strong> to identify blockers.</li>
    <li><strong>Document</strong> the real vs. intended process.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section-block">
